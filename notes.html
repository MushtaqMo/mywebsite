    <h1 class="coolText4">Notes, what are they? </h1>

<p>
Every perfume produced contains a variety of ingredients, these are known as "notes". For example, well loved notes such as "vanilla"
and "lavender". There a thousands of notes, synthetic and natural that are used in your every day perfumes. 
There are no limit to how many notes a perfume can hold, however, there are three categories. Top notes, middle notes
and base notes. 
</p>

    <h2 class="coolText4"> Top notes
    </h2>
    <p>
        These are the initial notes that you smell when you spray the perfume. Usually, they are citrus, or green notes. The Top
        notes only last a few seconds and do not linger.  
    </p>

    <h2 class="coolText4"> Middle notes</h2>
    <p>
        Slightly heavier than the top notes, the middle notes can last upto two hours. Middle notes tend to be floral or
        spicy.
    </p>


    <h2 class="coolText4"> Base notes </h2>
    <p>
       Lastly, the base notes last the longest. They are often the strongest, richest notes that can linger on skin or clothes
       for several hours. Sometimes, even days. Popular base notes include vanilla, amber and sandalwood.
