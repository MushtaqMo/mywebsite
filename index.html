<p class="coolText">

    Perfume has been around since ancient times. Perfume has been said to have been discovered by
    early Egyptians from 3000 BC to 100 BC. To create scents, egyptians in acient times often used lotus flower,
    water lillies, roses and cinnemon. To create their perfume they would soak the plants in oil to create a concentrated perfume.
    Unfortunately, only the rich could afford to have the luxury to own perfume. Luckily, in modern times
    there are many cheap, yet good quality perfumes for people of all economical class backgrounds to use and enjoy.
